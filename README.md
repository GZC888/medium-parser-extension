<h1 align="center">Medium Parser</h1>

*Medium parser is a web browser extension to help read the member-only articles on medium.com*

## Installation Instructions
**Google Chrome / Microsoft Edge / Chromium Browsers (Brave/Opera Mini)** (Custom sites supported)
1. Download this repo as a [ZIP file from GitHub](https://github.com/Xatta-Trone/medium-parser-extension/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
1. Unzip the file and you should have a folder named `medium-parser-extension-master`.
1. In Chrome/Edge go to the extensions page (`chrome://extensions` or `edge://extensions`).
1. Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle button on the top right side of the browser.
1. Drag the `medium-parser-extension-master` folder anywhere on the page to import it (do not delete the folder afterwards).


**Mozilla Firefox** (Custom sites not supported)
* [Download and install the latest version](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/medium-parser/)

### Troubleshooting
* This extension pulls the data from `webcache.googleusercontent.com`; then removes all the scripts and sends back the html and css contents only. It might not work when there is no data from the request. 
* This extension does not work when medium redirects to external sites.
